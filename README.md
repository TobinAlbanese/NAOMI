# üåø NAOMI

**Neural Analysis for Observation of Micro-Expressions & Intent**

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

NAOMI is a cutting-edge AI tool designed to analyze **micro-expressions** and subtle facial cues from video streams or images, unlocking hidden emotional states, deception indicators, and intent signals. It supports security, intelligence, and behavioral research by enhancing human observational capacity with precise, real-time AI analysis.

## üéØ Vision & Goals

- **Micro-Expression Detection:** Capture fleeting facial movements invisible to the naked eye.  
- **Intent & Emotion Analysis:** Infer stress, deception, confidence, and other psychological states.  
- **Real-Time Video Processing:** Streamlined pipeline for live camera feeds and recorded footage.  
- **Augmented Feedback:** Provide visual overlays and confidence scores for rapid analyst interpretation.  
- **Training & Calibration:** Customizable models trained on diverse populations and contexts.  
- **Integration-Ready:** API-first design for embedding into larger surveillance or analysis suites.
