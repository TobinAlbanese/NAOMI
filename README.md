# üåø NAOMI  
**Neural Analysis for Observation of Micro-Expressions & Intent**

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

NAOMI is an advanced AI platform designed to detect and analyze **micro-expressions** ‚Äî tiny, fleeting facial movements that often reveal hidden emotions like stress, deception, or confidence. Leveraging computer vision and machine learning, NAOMI processes live video or recorded footage in real-time, providing deep insights into human intent and emotional state.

Ideal for security analysts, intelligence operatives, psychologists, and behavioral researchers, NAOMI enhances human observation by delivering precise, data-driven facial behavior analysis.

## üéØ Vision & Goals

- **Micro-Expression Detection:** Identify subtle facial muscle movements invisible to the naked eye that indicate concealed emotions.  
- **Intent & Emotion Analysis:** Use AI to classify psychological states such as deception, nervousness, confidence, or stress based on facial cues.  
- **Real-Time Processing:** Support live video streams and pre-recorded videos with low-latency analysis for immediate decision-making.  
- **Visual Augmentation:** Provide interactive heatmaps, facial landmark overlays, and confidence scores for intuitive analyst interpretation.  
- **Custom Model Training:** Allow users to retrain and fine-tune models on specific demographics or environments for improved accuracy.  
- **Secure & Compliant Data Handling:** Encrypt video and analysis data, with role-based access controls to protect sensitive information.  
- **API Integration:** Offer a robust API to embed NAOMI‚Äôs capabilities into larger surveillance or intelligence platforms.
